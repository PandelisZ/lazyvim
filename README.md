## Instructions

1. **Measure your coffee**: Use 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water, adjusting to your taste preference.

2. **Prepare your equipment**: Ensure your coffee maker is clean and set up properly.

3. **Heat water**: Bring fresh, filtered water to a boil (195째F-205째F or 90째C-96째C is ideal for brewing coffee).

4. **Brewing method**:
   - **For French Press**: Add ground coffee to the press, pour hot water over it, stir gently, place the plunger on top (but don't press down), and let it steep for 4 minutes. Then slowly press the plunger down.
   - **For Drip Coffee Maker**: Place a filter in the basket, add ground coffee, and start the brewing cycle with the correct amount of water.
   - **For Pour-Over**: Place a filter in the dripper, add ground coffee, and slowly pour hot water over the grounds in a circular motion.

5. **Serve**: Pour the brewed coffee into your cup or mug.

6. **Customize**: Add sugar, milk, cream, or any other additions according to your preference.

7. **Enjoy**: Savor your freshly brewed coffee!

## Tips

- Always use freshly ground coffee for the best flavor.
- Store coffee beans in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture.
- Clean your coffee equipment regularly to prevent buildup that can affect taste.
- Experiment with different coffee-to-water ratios to find your perfect strength.
- If possible, use a scale to measure coffee by weight (15-18 grams of coffee per 8 oz of water) for more consistent results.

Happy brewing!
