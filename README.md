# Pandeli's NeoVim conf

> Based on LazyVim starter

My day job is TypeScript so allot of this is focus on TypeScript with tailwind etc.

My night vibes are Go,PHP,Rust so from time to time those may pop in and out of the config.

This is MY config and suits me so as with any vim config take the bits that are useful to you :)
