# Pandeli's NeoVim Configuration

> A personalized NeoVim setup based on LazyVim starter

## Overview

This is my personal NeoVim configuration optimized for modern web development. It's designed to provide a seamless development experience with carefully selected plugins and optimizations.

## Primary Focus

- **TypeScript** development with comprehensive LSP support
- **Tailwind CSS** integration for efficient styling workflows
- Modern web development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)

## Secondary Languages

While primarily focused on web technologies, this configuration also includes support for:

- **Go** - For backend and systems programming
- **PHP** - For web application development
- **Rust** - For performance-critical applications

## Customization

This is MY personal configuration that has evolved to match my specific workflow and preferences. Feel free to:

- Use it as inspiration for your own setup
- Cherry-pick the parts that are useful to you
- Modify any aspect to better suit your needs

Remember that the best NeoVim configuration is the one tailored to your own workflow!
