# How to Make Coffee

This README provides a comprehensive guide on how to brew a perfect cup of coffee using the pour-over method.

## Ingredients and Equipment

### Ingredients:
- Fresh coffee beans (medium to dark roast recommended)
- Filtered water

### Equipment:
- Coffee grinder
- Digital scale
- Kettle (preferably gooseneck)
- Pour-over dripper (like V60, Chemex, or Kalita Wave)
- Filter paper compatible with your dripper
- Coffee mug
- Timer (optional)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Preparation

- Measure 20-25 grams of coffee beans for a standard cup (adjust to taste)
- Heat 350-400ml of water to 195-205°F (90-96°C)
- Place your dripper on top of your mug
- Insert filter paper into the dripper

### 2. Rinse the Filter

- Pour a small amount of hot water through the empty filter
- This removes any paper taste and preheats your equipment
- Discard the rinse water from your mug

### 3. Grind the Coffee

- Grind your coffee beans to a medium-fine consistency (similar to table salt)
- Add the ground coffee to your filter, creating a flat bed

### 4. The Bloom

- Start your timer if using one
- Pour just enough hot water (about twice the weight of your coffee) to saturate all grounds
- Gently stir to ensure all coffee is wet
- Let it "bloom" for 30-45 seconds (this releases CO2 and improves flavor)

### 5. Main Pour

- Slowly pour the remaining water in a circular motion
- Maintain a steady pour, keeping the water level consistent
- The total brew time should be between 2:30-3:30 minutes

### 6. Enjoy

- Once all water has dripped through, remove the dripper
- Swirl your coffee gently to mix
- Let it cool slightly before drinking for optimal flavor

## Variations

- For a stronger cup, increase the coffee-to-water ratio
- For a milder cup, decrease the coffee-to-water ratio
- Experiment with different bean origins and roast levels to discover your preference

## Tips for Better Coffee

- Always use freshly roasted beans (within 2-4 weeks of roast date)
- Grind your beans immediately before brewing
- Use filtered water for the cleanest taste
- Consistent technique will yield consistent results
