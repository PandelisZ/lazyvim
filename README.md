# Pandeli's NeoVim Configuration

> A personal Neovim setup based on LazyVim starter

## Overview

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, designed to support my development workflow across various languages and frameworks. It builds upon the excellent LazyVim starter template with customizations tailored to my specific needs.

## Focus Areas

### Primary Technologies
- **TypeScript** with Tailwind CSS (primary day job focus)
- Comprehensive web development tooling

### Secondary Languages
- **Go**, **PHP**, and **Rust** support (for personal projects)
- Configurable based on current interests and project requirements

## Configuration

This setup includes several configuration files:
- `.neoconf.json` - Project-specific Neovim configuration
- `lazyvim.json` - LazyVim specific settings
- `lua/` directory - Custom Lua scripts and plugin configurations

## Customization

This is a highly personalized configuration that suits my specific workflow and preferences. If you're using this as a reference:

- Feel free to cherry-pick components that work for you
- Modify settings to match your own preferences
- Use it as inspiration rather than a drop-in solution

As with any Vim configuration, the best setup is one that you've tailored to your own needs! ðŸš€
